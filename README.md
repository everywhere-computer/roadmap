# Welcome to the Everywhere Computer Roadmap

## Where is the roadmap?

There are three main views:
1. An [Overview](https://github.com/orgs/everywhere-computer/projects/1) of what's in progress now, what's up next, and what we are considering for the near future.
2. A [Wishlist](https://github.com/orgs/everywhere-computer/projects/1/views/3) of items that have been reviewed by our team, but haven't been prioritized yet.
3. An inbox of [Fresh Requests](https://github.com/orgs/everywhere-computer/projects/1/views/6) that haven't been reviewed by our team yet.

## How can I request a feature?

1. Take a look through the roadmap views above to make sure it hasn't already been requested

## How often is the roadmap updated?
